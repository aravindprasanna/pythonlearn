Python for Everybody TODO List
------------------------------

Welcome to the under-construction book "Python 3.0 for Everybody".

Feel free to add things to this TODO list and/or file GitHub
Issues to track activity.

Tasks to do:

* Fix all the sample code in the code3 folder - please leave the 
code folder alone - it will remain Python 2.0 forever

* Go through the chapters and fix all the code sequences 
that autoconversion missed or messed up - fix any Python 2.0 
and then run the code to verify the output

* Double check the output of the interactive sequences

* Make a new awesome cover

* Add Object Oriented chapter if time permits

* Add HTML Server chapter if time permits

* Add Graphical UI QT chapter if time permits

And many other things...
